"CSlib documentation"_Manual.html

Quick tour :h3

You can quickly try out the CSlib if you

build the CSlib
build the test programs that use the CSlib
run the test programs :ul

You can do this step-by-step (below), or do all these steps in one
command from the test dir:

% cd cslib/test
% sh Run_serial.sh      # for serial apps
% sh Run_parallel.sh    # for parallel apps
% sh Run_mixed.sh       # for mixed apps (language, serial/parallel, etc) :pre

These shell scripts build and run in all languages (C++, C, Fortran,
Python), and for serial and parallel (via MPI).  This includes a
socket mode via the ZeroMQ (ZMQ) library.  So if support for some of
the options is not available on your system, apps may not build or
run.  In which case you can try the 3-step process below.

You can examine the source code of any of the apps in the test dir to
see the logic and syntax for using the CSlib from your application.
They invoke every method provided by the CSlib.

:line

Build the CSlib with one of these make commands.  This should produce
one or more lib*.so files.  If you're stuck, read "this
section"_#buildlib.

% cd cslib/src
% make                # build 2 shared CSlibs: parallel & serial
% make zmq=no         # ditto if you don't have the ZeroMQ lib on your system
% make shlib_serial   # just the serial lib if you don't have MPI on your system :pre

:line

Build the test programs.  This should produce pairs of executable
files that start with "client" and "server".  If you're stuck, read
"this section"_#buildtest.

% cd cslib/test
% make all           # build all the apps (CSlib and simple)
% make serial        # build the CSlib serial apps, don't need MPI
% make parallel      # build the CSlib parallel apps, except fortran
% make f90           # build the CSlib fortran apps, serial & parallel :pre

:line

Run the test programs from the test dir.  Launch the client app in one
window, the server app in another.  It doesn't matter which is
launched first.  At the end, you should see output from the client for
the effective messaging bandwidth, and an indication if any errors
occurred.  The server should just silently exit.  If you're stuck,
read "this section"_#runtest.  The test apps are explained in more
detail in "this section"_testapps.html.

These are the command-line args for the client and server apps:

mode = file or zmq                          # for serial apps
mode = file or zmq or mpi/one or mpi/two    # for parallel apps
Nlen = length of vectors to exchange
Niter = number of exchanges
dtype = Python data type: 1 for list, 2 for Numpy, 3 for ctypes :pre

IMPORTANT NOTE: You must specify the same mode and Nlen for both apps.
For mode = mpi/one, launch both apps via a single mpirun command, not
two commands in two windows, for example:

% mpirun -np 2 client_parallel mode Nlen Niter : -np 4 server_parallel mode Nlen :pre

Note that to run the Python apps, you must enable Python to find the
CSlib shared library and src/cslib.py wrapper script.  To run the
parallel Python apps, you must have mpi4py installed in your Python.
See "this section"_python.html for details on both these topics.

Serial C++, C, Fortran, Python:

% client mode Nlen Niter    # launch in one window
% server mode Nlen          # launch in second window :pre     

% client_c mode Nlen Niter
% server_c mode Nlen :pre

% client_f90 mode Nlen Niter
% server_f90 mode Nlen :pre

% python client.py mode Nlen Niter dtype
% python server.py mode Nlen dtype :pre

Parallel C++, C, Fortran, Python:

% mpirun -np 2 client_parallel mode Nlen Niter
% mpirun -np 4 server_parallel mode Nlen :pre

% mpirun -np 2 client_parallel_c mode Nlen Niter
% mpirun -np 4 server_parallel_c mode Nlen :pre

% mpirun -np 2 client_parallel_f90 mode Nlen Niter
% mpirun -np 4 server_parallel_f90 mode Nlen :pre

% mpirun -np 2 python client_parallel.py mode Nlen Niter dtype
% mpirun -np 4 python server_parallel.py mode Nlen dtype :pre

Mix and match langauges and serial vs parallel.  A serial and parallel
app can only use the CSlib together for mode = file or zmq.  If mode =
mpi/two is used, both apps MUST be launched with mpirun, even if one
or both of them only runs on a single processor.

% client mode Nlen Niter
% server_c mode Nlen :pre

% client mode Nlen Niter
% python server.py mode Nlen :pre

% client mode Nlen Niter
% mpirun -np 4 python server.py mode Nlen dtype :pre

% mpirun -np 2 client_parallel mode Nlen Niter
% mpirun -np 4 server_parallel_f90 mode Nlen dtype :pre

% mpirun -np 2 client_parallel mode Nlen Niter
% mpirun -np 4 python server_parallel.py mode Nlen dtype :pre
