<H3>Features 
</H3>
<P>The CSlib currently supports 4 messaging protocols or "modes" of
code-to-code coupling:
</P>
<UL><LI>file = via files
<LI>zmq = via sockets
<LI>mpi/one = via MPI, where two apps are launched with one mpirun command
<LI>mpi/two = ditto but launched with two mpirun commands 
</UL>
<P>The file mode sends messages by writing/reading binary files.
</P>
<P>The zmq mode is implemented using the open-soure <A HREF = "http://zeromq.org">ZeroMQ socket
library</A>, referred to in this manual as ZMQ.
</P>
<P>The two mpi modes send messages via the distributed-memory <A HREF = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface">message
passing interface (MPI)</A>.  They differ only in how the two
applications (apps) are launched via MPI's mpirun or mpiexec command
and in how the MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator and processor ranks are
assigned to each app.
</P>




<P>From the app's persepective (client or server code) all these modes
function identically.  The same calls are made to the CSlib, other
than arguments to the constructor that chooses the messaging mode.
For the "mpi/one" mode each application may also want to split the MPI
communicator (MPI_COMM_WORLD) so that each app runs in its own
communicator.  This is discussed in <A HREF = "language.html">this section</A>.
</P>
<P>In the CSlib, a "message" has a numeric ID and can contain zero or
more "fields".  A field contains zero or more datums of a single
"type".  A type is an integer or floating-point value with 32-bit or
64-bit precision.  Character strings are also supported.  Arbitrary
byte sequences may be supported in a future release.
</P>
<P>When a client or server code is run in parallel as a
distributed-memory app, using MPI, only one of its processors
participates in the CSlib messaging.  In MPI parlance, the proc 0 of
one code communicates with the proc 0 of the other, either by files,
via a socket, or via MPI sends and receives.
</P>
<P>However, all processors in each app call the CSlib functions
simultaneously.  They can format their messages in one of 2 ways.  For
sending, all processors can provide a copy of the same send data.  Or
if the data is distributed across the processors, each can provide its
portion to the send() call.  Likewise when the recv() is called, all
processors can receive a copy of the entire message.  Or if the data
is meant to be distributed, each can receive its portion.  The CSlib
communicates data via MPI within the client and server apps to
accomplish this.
