<H3>Build the test apps 
</H3>
<P>This is done from the test dir after building the CSlib, as explained
in <A HREF = "#buildlib">this section</A>.
</P>
<P>As explained in <A HREF = "testapps.html">this section</A>, the test dir contains
pairs of client/server programs which use the CSlib (CSlib test apps),
as well of pairs of simple client/server apps which call the ZMQ and
MPI libraries directly.
</P>
<P>There is a single Makefile for building all of them.  Type "make" to
see this list.
</P>
<PRE>make all           build all the CSlib and simple apps
make serial        build the CSlib serial apps, except fortran
make parallel      build the CSlib parallel apps, except fortran
make f90           build the CSlib fortran apps, serial & parallel
make simple        build the simple apps
make pair          build a single pair of c/s apps (list below) 
</PRE>
<PRE>single pairs of test apps:
  C++: serial_c++, parallel_c++
  C:   serial_c, parallel_c
  F90: serial_f90, parallel_f90
single pairs of simple apps:
  simple_zmq, simple_mpi_one, simple_mpi_two 
</PRE>
<P>Try the "make all" build first.  If you have MPI on your system and
the requisite compilers, everything should just build.  If not, you
can use the other targets to avoid building certain executables.  Or
you can type commands like this if you only want to build specific
pairs of client/server apps.
</P>
<PRE>make serial_c++
make parallel_c
make simple_mpi_one 
</PRE>
<P>When builds are successful, you should have pairs of client and server
executable files with the corresponding names in the test dir.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: To build the serial CSlib apps, you must link against
the serial shared CSlib library.  To build the parallel CSlib apps,
you must link against the parallel shared CSlib library.  As explained
in <A HREF = "#buildlib">this section</A>, you can build both these versions of the
CSlib by simply typing "make" in the src dir.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you only built static versions of the CSlib, and
you built the CSlib with ZMQ support, you will need to include the ZMQ
library in the link lines in this Makefile (or a similar Makefile you
use to build your own apps).
</P>
<P>The Makefile assumes that standard compilers and MPI wrappers are in
your path.  If that is not the case or you wish to use different
compilers or flags, you can create/edit a new Makefile,
e.g. Makefile.mine, and invoke it as follows:
</P>
<PRE>make -f Makefile.mine target ...
