2018.  The CSlib is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or
add a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of the CSlib contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  The version date is stored in the
src/version.h file in the CSlib distribution.  It is also in the CSlib
directory name created when you unpack a tarball.
