"CSlib documentation"_Manual.html

More Python details :h3

The CSlib can be used from a client or server app written in Python
using a provided Python wrapper on the C interface to the CSlib.
Currently only Python 2.7 is supported.  At some point we'll make a
Python 3 compatible version of the wrapper.

This section describes a few additional requirements when using
Python as well as a few options Python enables:

"Building the CSlib for use from Python"_#pybuild
"Accessing the CSlib from Python at runtime"_#pyrun
"Parallel Python via mpi4py"_#pyparallel
"Sending, receiving Python lists, Numpy arrays, ctypes vectors"_pydata

Building the CSlib for use from Python" :h4,link(pybuild)

A Python script loads the CSlib at runtime, which requires the CSlib
to be built as a shared library, either for parallel or serial use.
This can be done from the src directory by typing "make shlib".  See
"this section"_#buildlib for more details and options.

Loading the CSlib from Python at runtime :h4,link(pyrun)

The Python interface to the CSlib is a single file src/cslib.py that
implements a CSlib Python class.  An instance of the class can be
created in a Python app as follows, where the arguments to open() are
explained in "this section"_create.html:

from CSlib import CS
cs = CSlib.open(...) :pre

If either of these lines gives an error, take the following steps, and
try again.

The error is likely because Python cannot find src/cslib.py and a
shared library build of the CSlib (libcs.so or libcsnompi.so), which
is also in the src dir.

The simplest way to fix this, is to define (or extend) two environment
variables.  If you do this in your shell start-up script you only need
to do it once.  These examples use my local path for the CSlib; alter
for your system accordingly:

For bash, type these lines or add them to ~/.bashrc:

export PYTHON_PATH="$PYTHON_PATH:/home/sjplimp/cslib/src"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/sjplimp/cslib/src" :pre

For csh or tcsh, type these lines or add them to ~/.cshrc:

setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:/home/sjplimp/cslib/src
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/sjplimp/cslib/src :pre

After editing, do this in an already-existing terminal window, so
the path changes take effect:

% source .bashrc
% source .cshrc :pre

Alternatively, you can extend your PYTHON_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
when you run a client or server Python script, before you import
and instantiate the CSlib:

% python
>>> import sys,os
>>> sys.path.append("/home/sjplimp/cslib/src")   # path = PYTHON_PATY
>>> sys.path                # to verify PYTHON_PATH has been extended
>>> os.environ("LD_LIBRARY_PATH") += ":home/sjplimp/cslib/src"
>>> os.environ("LD_LIBRARY_PATH") # to verify LD_LIBRARY_PATH has been extended :pre

Alternatively, you can copy the files (cslib.py and libcs*.so) to
someplace your current PYTHON_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables
already point to.

"Parallel python via mpi4py :h4,link(pyparallel)

For an app (Python or not) to use the CSlib in parallel, it must pass
an MPI communicator to the CSlib.  Such an app also typically makes
MPI calls in the app itself to work in parallel.  To do both of these
in Python, use the "mpi4py"_http://www.mpi4py.org Python package.

To see if mpi4y is already part of your Python type this line:

>>> from mpi4py import MPI

If it works you should be able to run this test.py script
like this: mpirun -np 4 python test.py

from mpi4py import MPI
world = MPI.COMM_WORLD
me = world.rank
nprocs = world.size
print "Me %d Nprocs %d" % (me,nprocs) :pre

and get 4 lines of output "Me N Nprocs 4", where N = 0,1,2,3.

If the import fails, you need to install mpi4py in your Python.
Here are two ways to do it.

If you are using "anaconda"_http://www.anaconda.org for your Python
package management, simply type the following which will download and
install it:

conda install mpi4py :pre

If not, you can download mpi4py from its web site
"http://www.mpi4py.org"_http://www.mpi4py.org, unpack it, and install
it via pip:

pip install mpi4py :pre

Once installed, the test.py example script above should run.

IMPORTANT NOTE: When mpi4py is installed in your Python, it compiles
an MPI library (e.g. inside conda) or uses a pre-existing MPI library
it finds on your system.  This MUST be the same MPI library that the
CSlib and the client and server apps are built with and link to,
i.e. if other apps are not written in Python.  If they do not match,
you will typically get run-time MPI errors when your client and server
apps run.

You can inspect the path to the MPI library that mpi4py uses like this:

% python
>>> import mpi4py
>>> mpi4py.get_config() :pre

Sending, receiving Python lists, Numpy arrays, ctypes vectors :h4,link(pydata)

Python has several ways to represent a 1d vector or multi-dimensional
array (2d, 3d, etc) of numeric values.  Once created, all of them can
be accessed with the same syntax, e.g. sdouble\[500\] = 3.4 for the 1d
vector, or value = sarray\[500\]\[2\] for the 2d array.

Python list or tuple:

nlen = 1000
sint = (1,4,3,8,6)                          # 5-length tuple (values cannot be changed)
sdouble = nlen*\[0.0\]                 # 1000-length 1d vector
sarray = \[3*\[0\] for i in range(nlen)\]    # 1000x3 2d array (list of lists)

Numpy arrays:

import numpy as np
nlen = 1000
sdouble = np.zeros(nlen,np.float)    # 1000-length vector
sarray = np.zeros((nlen,3),np.float)  # 1000x3 2d array

ctypes vectors or arrays:

import ctypes
sdouble = (nlen * ctypes.c_double)()   # 1000-length vector
sarray = (nlen * (3 * ctypes.c_double))()  # 1000x3 2d array

The Numpy arrays and ctypes vectors store numeric data internally as
contiguous chunks of memory, which Python lists or tuples do not.  For
numeric operations in Python the Numpy arrays are typically most
efficient, since you can call Numpy functions which operate on the
vectors or arrays with C code.  The Numpy arrays and ctypes vectors
have the additional advantage that when you send and receive them with
the CSlib, their data does not need to be copied into C-compatible
data structures.

Data in all 3 of these formats, including a Python tuple, can be sent
as a field in a message via the pack() methods described in "this
section"_send.html.  The cslib.py wrapper detects which format the
data is in, and converts it via ctypes to a C-style vector in order to
call the C interface to the CSlib.  For a Python list or tuple this
requires coping the data into a ctypes vector before calling the
library.  For the Numpy and ctypes formats, no copy is needed.

When a field is unpacked from a received message via the unpack()
methods described in "this section"_receive.html, you can choose to
have the data returned to the Python app in any of the 3 formats.
This is done by using an optional final argument "tflag" to the
unpack() and unpack_parallel() methods.

tflag = 1 = Python list
tflag = 2 = Numpy 1d vector
tflag = 3 = ctypes 1d vector (default) :ul

For tflag=1, this requires coping the data into a Python list.  For
the Numpy and ctypes formats, no copy is needed.
