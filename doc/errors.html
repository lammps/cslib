<H3>Error messages 
</H3>
<P>The CSlib will print an error message and halt when an error condition
is detected.  Here is more info about these errors.  The first field
of the messages is which CSlib method triggered the error.
</P>
<HR>

<PRE>constructor(): CSlib invoked with MPI_Comm but built w/out MPI support
constructor(): CSlib invoked w/out MPI_Comm but built with MPI support 
</PRE>
<P>A serial app (which passes a NULL to the constructor of the CSlib)
must be linked with a serial version of the CSlib.  Likewise a
parallel app (which passes an MPI communicator to the constructor of
the CSlib) must be linked with a parallel version of the CSlib.  See
<A HREF = "buildlib.html">this section</A> for how to build the CSlib for serial or
parallel use.
</P>
<PRE>constructor(): No mpi/one mode for serial lib usage
constructor(): No mpi/two mode for serial lib usage 
</PRE>
<P>If the CSlib is being used in serial, the "mpi/one" and "mpi/two"
modes of messaging cannot be used.
</P>
<PRE>constructor(): Invalid client/server arg
constructor(): Unknown mode 
</PRE>
<P>The csflag or mode args to the CSlib constructor are incorrect.
</P>
<PRE>constructor(): Library not built with ZMQ support
constructor(): Server could not make socket connect 
</PRE>
<P>These are possible errors when mode = "zmq" is used.  The first error
means the socket mode (zmq) of messaging cannot be requested if the
CSlib was built without the ZeroMQ (ZMQ) library.  See <A HREF = "buildlib.html">this
section</A> for more info.  The second error occurs is the
ZMQ library is unable to connect the socket between the client and
server apps.  Check that the port string was specified correctly for
both apps.
</P>
<HR>

<PRE>send(): Invalid nfield
send(): Message header size exceeds 32-bit integer limit
send(): Could not open send message file 
</PRE>
<P>Nfield must be >= 0.  If it is too large (100s of millions), the 2nd
error can occur.  The 3rd error occurs when mode = "file" and a
message file cannot be opened.  Check the syntax of the path/file that
was specified correctly and that the apps have read/write access to
the file.
</P>
<PRE>pack(): Reuse of field ID
pack(): Invalid ftype
pack(): Invalid flen 
</PRE>
<P>The same field ID cannot be packed twice.  Valid ftypes are 1,2,3,4.
Flen must be >= 0.
</P>
<PRE>pack_parallel(): Reuse of field ID
pack_parallel(): Invalid ftype
pack_parallel(): Invalid nlocal
pack_parallel(): Invalid nper 
</PRE>
<P>The same field ID cannot be packed twice.  Valid ftypes are currently
1,2,3,4.  Nlocal must be >= 0.  Nper must be >= 1.
</P>
<PRE>pack(): Message size exceeds 32-bit integer limit 
</PRE>
<P>The size of the entire send message buffer must be <= 2^31 bytes,
which is around 2 billion bytes.
</P>
<HR>

<PRE>recv(): Could not open recv message file 
</PRE>
<P>The error occurs when mode = "file" and a message file cannot be
opened.  Check the syntax of the path/file that was specified
correctly and that the apps have read/write access to the file.
</P>
<PRE>unpack_int(): Unknown field ID        # ditto for int64, float, double, string
unpack_int(): Mis-match of ftype     # ditto for int64, float, double, string
unpack_int(): Flen is not 1                # ditto for int64, float, double, but not string 
</PRE>
<P>The received message does not conatin the requested field ID.  The
requested data type (int, int64, float, double, string) does not match
the data type of the sent field.  The length of the sent field must be
one to use these unpack methods.  Except for unpack_string() which can
retrieve a string of any length.
</P>
<PRE>unpack(): Unknown field ID 
</PRE>
<P>The received message does not conatin the requested field ID.
</P>
<PRE>unpack_parallel(): Unknown field ID
unpack_parallel(): Invalid nlocal
unpack_parallel(): Invalid nper 
</PRE>
<P>The received message does not conatin the requested field ID.
Nlocal must be >= 0.  Nper must be >= 1.
</P>
<HR>

<PRE>extract(): Invalid flag 
</PRE>
<P>Valid flags are currently 1 or 2.
</P>
<HR>

<P>malloc(): Failed to allocate N bytes
realloc(): Failed to reallocate N bytes
</P>
<P>These are interal errors within the CSlib.  A memory allocation or
reallocate of N bytes failed.  This could be because the allocation
was too large, or because the system does not have sufficient memory.
</P>
