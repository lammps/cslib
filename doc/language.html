<H4><A NAME = "header"></A>Header files and modules to include 
</H4>
<P>Include these lines in any app file that makes calls to
the CSlib.
</P>
<P>C++:
</P>
<PRE>#include "cslib.h"              // found in src dir
using namespace CSLIB_NS; 
</PRE>
<P>This is the CSlib class header file and its namespace If you prefer
not to use the namespace, you can prepend the namespace to the call
that instantiates the CSlib and the pointer it returns, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>CSLIB_NS::CSlib *cs = new CSLIB_NS::CSlib(csflag,mode,str,&world); 
</PRE>
<P>C:
</P>
<PRE>#include "cslib_wrap.h"          // found in src dir 
</PRE>
<P>This is the C-style wrapper on the CSlib class, found in src.
</P>
<P>Fortran (2003 or later):
</P>
<P>Include these lines in any program element (main program, subroutine,
function, etc) which calls the CSlib:
</P>
<PRE>USE iso_c_binding       ! standard Fortran module
USE cslib_wrap          ! found in src or test dir 
</PRE>
<P>The iso_c_binding module defines the C-style data types and functions
used in calls to CSlib.  The cslib_wrap module defines how Fortran
calls the C interface to the CSlib.  The code for the interface is in
src/cslib_wrap.f90 file (also test/cslib_wrap.f90).  That file must be
compiled with the app; you can simply copy it into the directory with
other app source files.
</P>
<P>Python:
</P>
<PRE>import cslib as CS      # found in src dir
from mpi4py import MPI 
</PRE>
<P>The first line references the file src/cslib.py which defines a Python
CSlib class which wraps the C interface to the CSlib.  The second line
is only necessary if you are running a parallel Python application, so
that you can pass an MPI communicator to the CSlib.
</P>
<P>See more details in <A HREF = "python.html">this section</A> on how to insure these
two lines will work in your Python.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "datatypes"></A>Compatible data types 
</H4>
<P>For the data types the CSlib supports, these are the equivalent native
data types in different languages.  If sending a message with this
type of data, you need to be sure both the client and server app agree
on how to declare the data.
</P>

<P>Note that a character string in Fortran can also be declared as
"character(len=32)" for sending. But for receiving, declare it as
"character(c_char), pointer" and use the c_f_pointer() function to
convert the received C-style string into the correct Fortran length.
This is discussed below.
</P>
<P>Note that regular Python does not require declaration of data types.
You can assign values like this:
</P>
<UL><LI>a = 5
<LI>a = 3000000000
<LI>a = 1.5
<LI>a = 1.5e-200
<LI>a = "hello" 
</UL>
<P>and Python knows whether it is an integer (any precision), floating
point, or string, and will send/receive it to/from the CSlib
correctly.  When using Numpy and ctypes within Python, it is
different.  When you allocate a vector or multidimentional array of
numeric data types, you must use the type identifiers above to declare
the data correctly.  See the Python test codes in the test dir for
examples.
</P>

<H4><A NAME = "strings"></A>Strings in C/C++ versus Fortran 
</H4>
<P>Character strings in C or C++ are NULL-terminated.  This means the
string "hello" requires 6 bytes of storage.  Strings in Fortran are
not NULL-terminated.  So "hello" uses only 5 bytes of storage.  Or it
may be assigned like this:
</P>
<PRE>character(len=32) :: string
string = "hello" 
</PRE>
<P>in which case 27 space characters are added to the end, to fill a
32-character string.
</P>
<P>Internally, the CSlib stores strings in the C/C++ format with a
trailing NULL.  This means a Fortran app that sends a string
must pass it to the CSlib in that format, via the pack_string()
method described in <A HREF = "send.html">this section</A>. For example,
</P>
<PRE>character(len=32) :: str = "hello
call cslib_pack_string(cs,1,trim(str)//c_null_char) 
</PRE>
<P>The trim() function trims trailing space (if any).  A c_null_char
is appended.
</P>
<P>Likewise a Fortran app that receives a string will receive it in the C
format, via the unpack_string() method described in <A HREF = "receive.html">this
section</A>.  For examples,
</P>
<P>character(c_char), pointer :: str(:) => null()
ptr = cslib_unpack_string(cs,1)
call c_f_pointer(ptr,str,[fieldlen(1)-1])
</P>
<P>The c_f_pointer() function assigs the C pointer to the string to the
Fortran variable str, and sets its lenght to one less than the
received fieldlen().  This removes the trailing NULL.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "contig"></A>Contiguous memory for 2d, 3d, etc arrays 
</H4>
<P>As explained in <A HREF = "send.html">this section</A> and <A HREF = "receive.html">this
section</A> data in multidimensional arrays can be passed as
an argument to pack() or pack_parallel() for sending (or received by
unpack_parallel()), but only if the data is stored contiguously in
memory.
</P>
<P>For Fortran and Python (Numpy arrays or ctypes arrays) this is the
case.  However for C/C++ it may not be the case, depending on how the
app creates a multidimensional array.  The data in this kind of 2d Nx3
array:
</P>
<PRE>int a<B>1000</B><B>3</B>; 
</PRE>
<P>is stored contiguously.  But its dimensions must be specified at
compile time.
</P>
<P>A "double **" pointer to an Nx3 2d array in C, is more flexible.  It
can be allocated at run time.  But it may not store the 3N values in
contiguous memory, depending on how it was allocated.  It may be a
pointer to N pointers, each of which points at 3 contiguous values.
But the N 3-vectors are not contiguous with each other.
</P>
<P>The example code in <A HREF = "send.html">this section</A> and <A HREF = "receive.html">this
section</A> assumes the allocation for a 2d array is done
contiguously (and later freed) via methods like this.  Note that in
malloc2d() there are two mallocs, one for 3N doubles (the data), the
other for N pointers.  A reference like &a<B>0</B><B>0</B> then points to the
data as a 1d chunk and can be passed to pack() or unpack_parallel().
</P>
<PRE>double **a = malloc2d(1000,3);
free2d(a); 
</PRE>
<PRE>double **malloc2d(int n1, int n2)
<I>
  int nbytes = n1*n2 * sizeof(double);
  double *data = (double *) malloc(nbytes);
  nbytes = n1 * sizeof(double *);
  double **array = (double **) malloc(nbytes); 
</PRE>
<PRE>  int n = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) <I>
    array<B>i</B> = &data<B>n</B>;
    n += n2;
  </I>
  return array;
</I> 
</PRE>
<PRE>void free2d(double **array)
<I>
  if (array == NULL) return;
  free(array<B>0</B>);
  free(array);
</I> 
</PRE>
<P>Similar mallocs/frees can be written for 3d, 4d, etc arrays.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "order"></A>Ordering of 2d, 3d, etc arrays in C/C++ versus Fortran 
</H4>
<P>Multidimensional arrays in Fortran store their data contiguously in
memory with the leftmost index varying fastest, and the rightmost
index varying slowest.  Thus for this array:
</P>
<PRE>integer(4) :: a(2,2) 
</PRE>
<P>the order of the elements in memory is a(1,1), a(2,1), a(1,2), a(2,2).
</P>
<P>For C/C++ it is the oppposite (assuming the array data is stored in
contiguous memory as described above, and not as pointers to
pointers).  The rightmost index varies fastest, the leftmost index
varies slowest.  So for this array:
</P>
<PRE>int a<B>2</B><B>2</B> 
</PRE>
<P>the order of the elements in memory is a<B>0</B><B>0</B>, a<B>0</B><B>1</B>, a<B>1</B><B>0</B>,
a<B>1</B><B>1</B>.
</P>
<P>Since the CSlib treats multidimensional arrays as simply a chunk of
contiguous memory, if you wish to send an array from a C/C++ app to a
Fortran app, or vice versa, you must declare them in the 2 languages
consistently.  For example, an array declared as Nx3 in C/C++
should be declared as 3xN in Fortran.
</P>

<H4><A NAME = "mpicomm"></A>Splitting an MPI communicator in different languages 
</H4>
<P>As explained in <A HREF = "create.html">this section</A>, if the CSlib is used with
messaging <I>mode</I> = "mpi/one", then both the client and server app are
running within the same MPI communicator which spans both the client
and server processors, typically MPI_COMM_WORLD.  That spanning
communicator is passed as an argument when the CSlib is created
(instantiated) by the app.  A <I>pworld</I> argument is also passed which
is the sub-communicator for the processors the client or server app is
running on.  To create the two sub-communicators, both apps must
execute a MPI_Comm_split() before instantiating the CSlib.  Note that
the MPI_Comm_split() call is synchronous; all processors in both the
client and server apps must call it at the same time.  Here is example
code for this operation in each language.  The line with the call to
CSlib or cslib is what instantiates the library with the two
communicators as arguments.
</P>
<P>C++:

<PRE>int me,nprocs,csflag;
MPI_Comm world,partial,both;

MPI_Comm_size(world,&nprocs);
cs = new CSlib(csflag,mode,&both,&world); 
</PRE>
