<UL><LI>If you use MR-MPI for something interesting, we'd like to hear about
it. 

<LI>If you write a paper using the MR-MPI library, we can post a citation
to it on this page. 

<LI>If you write a MapReduce program which calls the library, that others
would be interested in, you can send it and we'll include it in the
distribution. 

<LI>If you enhance the library itself or have ideas for doing so, we can
discuss including the improvements in future releases.
