<HR>

<P>Here are more details about the CSlib constructor arguments.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The client and server apps must specify all the
following arguments consistently in order to communicate.  The CSlib
has no way to detect if this is done incorrectly, since the two apps
run as separate executables.  The apps will likely just hang or even
crash if that happens.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>csflag</I> argument determines whether the app is the client or the
server.  Use <I>csflag</I> = 0 if the app is a client, <I>csflag</I> = 1 if the
app is a server.
</P>
<HR>

<P><I>Mode</I> can be one of 4 options.  Both apps must use the same <I>mode</I>.
The choice of <I>mode</I> determines how the <I>ptr</I> argument is specified.
</P>
<P>For <I>mode</I> = "file" = the 2 apps communicate via binary files.  The
<I>ptr</I> argument is a filename which can include a path, e.g. ptr =
"subdir/tmp.couple" or <I>ptr</I> = "/home/user/tmpdir/dummy1".  Files that
begin with this filename will be written, read, and deleted as
messaging is performed.  The filename must be the same for both the
client and server app.  For parallel apps running on a large parallel
machine, this must be a path/filename visible to both the client and
server, e.g. on the front-end or on a parallel filesystem.  It should
not be on a node's local filesystem if the proc 0 of the two apps run
on different nodes.  If the CSlib is instantiated multiple times (see
<A HREF = "usage.html">this section</A> for use cases), the filename must be unique
for each pair of client/server couplings.
</P>
<P>For <I>mode</I> = "zmq" = the 2 apps communicate via a socket.  The <I>ptr</I>
argument is different for the client and server apps.  For the client
app, ptr is the IP address (IPv4 format) or the DNS name of the
machine the server app is running on, followed by a port ID for the
socket, separated by a colon.  E.g.
</P>
<PRE>ptr = "localhost:5555"        # client and server running on same machine
ptr = "192.168.1.1:5555"      # server is 192.168.1.1
ptr = "deptbox.uni.edu:5555"  # server is deptbox.uni.edu 
</PRE>
<P>For the server, the socket is on the macjhine the server app is
running on, so ptr is simply
</P>
<PRE>ptr = "*:5555" 
</PRE>
<P>where "*" represents all available interfaces on this machine, and
5555 is the port ID.  Note that the port (5555 in this example) must
be specified as the same value by the client and server apps.
</P>
<P>Note that the client and server can run on different machines,
separated geographically, so long as the server accepts incoming TCP
requests on the specified port.
</P>
<P>TODO: Still need to answer these Qs
</P>
<UL><LI>What values can port ID have?
<LI>Need socket examples for a big cluster, how to find node IP addresses
<LI>Can 2 servers run on same machine with different ports? 
</UL>
<P>If the CSlib is instantiated multiple times, (see <A HREF = "usage.html">this
section</A> for use cases), the port ID (5555 in this example)
must be unique for each pair of client/server couplings.
</P>
<P>For <I>mode</I> = "mpi/one" or <I>mode</I> = "mpi/two", the 2 apps communicate
via MPI.  
</P>
<P>For "mpi/one", the <I>ptr</I> argument is a pointer to the MPI communicator
that spans both apps, while the <I>pworld</I> argument (discussed below) is
a pointer to the MPI communcator for just the client or server app.
This means the two apps must split the spanning communicator before
instantiating the CSlib, as discussed below.  The same as for <I>pworld</I>
discussed below, the <I>ptr</I> argument is NOT the MPI communicator
itself, but a pointer to it.
</P>
<P>For "mpi/two", the <I>ptr</I> argument is a filename created (then deleted)
for a one-time small exchange of information by the client and server
to setup an MPI inter-communicator for messaging between them.  As
with the file mode, the filename can contain a path, and the same
filename must be specified by the client and server.  On a large
parallel machine, this must be a path/filename visible to both the
client and server.  If the CSlib is instantiated multiple times (see
<A HREF = "usage.html">this section</A> for use cases), the filename must be unique
for each pair of client/server couplings.
</P>
<P>For more discussion on how to specify the <I>mode</I> and <I>ptr</I> arguments
when running client and server apps in different scenarios (on a
desktop, on two different machines, on a cluster or supercomputer),
see <A HREF = "launch.html">this section</A>.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>pworld</I> argument determines whether the app uses the CSlib in
serial versus parallel.  Use <I>pworld</I> = NULL for serial use.  For
parallel use, the app initializes MPI and runs within an MPI
communicator.  Typically this communicator is MPI_COMM_WORLD,
however depending on how you intend to call and use the CSlib
it could be a sub-communicator.  The latter is always the
case if <I>mode</I> = "mpi/one".  See the important note below.
</P>
<P><I>Pworld</I> is passed to the CSlib as a pointer to the communicator the
app is running on.  Note that <I>pworld</I> is NOT the MPI communicator
itself, rather a pointer to it.  This allows it to be specified as
NULL for serial use of the CSlib.  Thus if MPI_COMM_WORLD is the
communicator, the app can do something like this, as shown in the C++
code example above:
</P>
<PRE>MPI_Comm world = MPI_COMM_WORLD;
CSlib *cs = new CSlib(csflag,"zmq",port,&world); 
</PRE>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If <I>mode</I> = "mpi/one" then both the client and server
app are running within the same MPI communicator which spans both the
client and server processors, typically MPI_COMM_WORLD.  That spanning
communicator is passed as the <I>ptr</I> argument, as dicsussed above.  In
this case, <I>pworld</I> is the sub-communicator for the processors the
client or server app is running on.  To create the two
sub-communicators, both apps must invoke MPI_Comm_split() before
instantiating the CSlib.  Note that the MPI_Comm_split() call is
synchronous; all processors in BOTH the client and server apps must
call it.
</P>
<P>Example code for doing this in various langautes is given in <A HREF = "language.html">this
section</A>.
</P>
<HR>

<P>When an app has completed its messaging, it should destroy its
instance of the CSlib, freeing the memory it has allocated internally.
The syntax for this operation is shown in the code examples at the top
of this page.
</P>
<P>When using <I>mode</I> = "mpi/one", the app should also free the
sub-communicator it created, as in the code examples given in <A HREF = "language.html">this
section</A> for splitting the MPI communicator.
</P>
