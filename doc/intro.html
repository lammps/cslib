<H3>Introduction 
</H3>
<P>The Client/Server library (CSlib) tries to make it easy to couple two
stand-alone applications (apps) together via a simple messaging
paradigm, namely the client/server model.  It was designed with
scientific codes in mind, but could be used by any pair of apps that
match the client/server model as described in <A HREF = "model.html">this
section</A>.
</P>
<P>The library hides the details of the low-level messaging from the
apps.  Both apps may be serial, both may be parallel (via MPI), or one
can be serial and the other parallel.  This is useful in at least a
few scenarios:
</P>
<OL><LI>One or both of the codes is not a library, so the other code
cannot link to it and call it directly. 

<LI>You wish to run the codes in parallel on different numbers of
processors.  If the first code calls the other code as a library, and
you run in parallel with MPI, then both codes run on all the
processors.  This can be worked around, but the details can be
ugly. 

<LI>You want to create a generic protocol (format and content of messages)
that allows one kind of code A to couple to another kind of code B.
There may be multiple codes A and/or multiple codes B that could be
coupled interchangeably.  The CSlib enables a single protocol to be
defined between all A codes and all B codes.  By contrast if all the B
codes are libraries, each A code would need to include code to call
the various library interfaces, which are likely different. 

<LI>You want to run the two codes on different machines in different
geographic locations.  The socket mode of messaging can do
this. 
</OL>
<P>To use the library, one of the apps acts as a "client", the other as a
"server", as explained in <A HREF = "model.html">this section</A>.  Thus you need to
add client or server logic to an app to call the CSlib appropriately
and send/receive messages.  This is often easier to do than
reconfiguring a code to run as a library.  If it is impossible to add
new logic to an existing code (e.g. no access to source, or others
will not have access to source code changes you make), you may be able
to still write a simple wrapper on that code (e.g. via Python).  The
wrapper can call the CSlib and communicate with the other code.  The
wrapper can create input files for the black-box code, launch it, and
parse its output.
</P>
<P>It may make sense for the same app to be able to function as either a
client or server, depending on what kind of problem is being run.  In
this scenario, the same code could be launched twice, once as a client
and once as a server.  The two instances of the same code can then
exchange messages with each other.
</P>
<P>The CSlib can be used to couple N > 2 codes together.  Simply
instantiate the library once for each pair of codes you couple.  For
example, if N = 4, and each code needs to communicate with the other
3, the CSlib could be instantiated 6 times (4*3/2).  A pair of codes
can also both instantiate the CSlib twice (or more), each acting once
as a client and once as a server.  The two codes can then exchange
messages with each other on different communication "channels" as
needed.
</P>
<P>As described in the next section, the CSlib performs its messaging
between two parallel codes in a simple manner, using one processor of
each.  Thus it is not designed to efficiently couple codes when each
is running on 100s or 1000s of processors, and where they frequently
exchange large amounts of data.  This requires higher bandwidth
parallel data transfers, where many or all processors of each code
exchange data with each other simultaneously via MPI.
</P>
<P>Solutions to that problem typically use more specialized libraries and
require the two codes be linked together as one application.  Here are
references to papers and software on this topic:

<P>At some point we may extend the CSlib to include options for a more
parallel or high-bandwidth form of code coupling, either wrapping
these tools directly or using conceptual ideas they implement.
