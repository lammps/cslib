<CENTER><H2>Manual for the Client/Server messaging library (CSlib) 
</H2></CENTER>
<P>6 Mar 2018 version
</P>
<P>The Client/Server messaging library (CSlib) provides a simple
mechanism for coupling two independent codes together by enabling them
to exchange information via messages.  One code acts as the client,
the other as the server.  The messaging can be performed in various
modes: via files, sockets, or the distributed-memory message-passing
interface (MPI).  The client and server codes use the same simple
messaging API regardless of which mode they use.  Either code can run
in serial or parallel.
